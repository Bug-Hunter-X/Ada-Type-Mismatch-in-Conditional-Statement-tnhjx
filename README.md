This example demonstrates a common error in Ada programming where a type mismatch occurs in a conditional statement. The code attempts to treat an array of integers as an array of booleans, leading to unexpected behavior.  The solution shows how to correctly compare integer values to boolean conditions.  This is a subtle error easily missed and highlights the importance of type checking in Ada.
